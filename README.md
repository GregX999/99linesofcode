# 99LinesOfCode

A blog created by Greg Burger using GatsbyJS and a whole bunch of React plugins.

Feel free to poke around and see how I did things. Re-use parts that you want. I'm not a React or Gatsby Jedi - yet! (just trying to keep learning and make neat stuff), so it's probable there are ways to optimize and/or better organize the code - let me know if you see anything.

Oh, please don't plagiarize the articles. That would be totally not cool.
